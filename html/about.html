            I started with photography as a way to catalog my experiences outdoors. For me it was a way to live in the moment. <br> 
            Standing on a summit watching the sun fade beyond the horizon, and the stars slowly emerge from the inky blackness <br>
            consumes you on a level that's nearly indescribable. Taking those feelings and attempting to freeze them into a single <br>
            still frame is an incredible challenge, and a way that I've found truly motivates me to get out and experience the world. <br><br>
            
            When I began, I did that for me. It was my way of forcing myself to look at a moment from every angle, and truly experience <br>
            the moment I was in. As I grew in my photography I had several people ask where they could buy these prints, and while <br>
            the concept was foreign, the compliment is immense. I hope that you enjoy what you see, and above all that it encourages <br>
            you to get outside, see the beautiful planet we all live on, and experience moments of your own. And if you feel inclined <br>
            to hang one of my pictures on your wall, then you were with me when I took that shot, at least in spirit.
